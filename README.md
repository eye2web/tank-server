# tank-server 

A simple tank battle game, where developers battle to have their tank last standing!

## Getting started

Run this server using `./gradeW bootRun`.
This will start a server and serve the frontend at localhost:3000.

Contestants can now send HTTP commands to this API, to subscribe their tank, move and fire!

The possible commands are listed in the `Tanks.postman_collection.json`
